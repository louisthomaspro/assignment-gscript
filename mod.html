/* ASSIGN, Assignment Problem */

/* Written in GNU MathProg by Andrew Makhorin */

/* The assignment problem is one of the fundamental combinatorial
   optimization problems.

   In its most general form, the problem is as follows:

   There are a number of students and a number of projects. Any student can be
   assigned to perform any project, incurring some cost that may vary
   depending on the student-project assignment. It is required to perform all
   projects by assigning exactly one student to each project in such a way that
   the total cost of the assignment is minimized.
